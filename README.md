# open-source-contribution-guide
I decided to start working on some open-source projects but after some effort, I found it hard and tricky to start. So, I created this repository to document my experiences and challenges in the open-source world!

I'll keep this like a story so you won't get bored!
One day, I woke up and decided to contribute to an open-source project! I started by searching in GitHub and investigating big projects like Linux, Apache-Kafka, docker, etc. But it didn't take me long to figure out that cannot contribute to any of them, because of their complexity and my inexperience. So, I decided to change my approach and searched around the internet and came across [awesome-for-beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) repository.

There is a long list of projects in almost every PL there that are suitable for beginners to start working on. At that moment, I thought all my problems were solved and I could dive into one of those projects and start coding and making pull requests. But again, it didn't take me so long to find out that I'm an idiot!

I wanted to contribute to a C/C++ project. So, I chose the `neovim` and started reading simple issues and tried to solve them but after a few hours, I found out that I needed to read the project source code first and get familiar with its structure.

As a result, I started reading its documents and source code, and here is where our journey begins! I decided to document my first experience of understanding and contributing to a rather big open-source project and I hope that it helps some others like me!
